# Netlib LP Test Problems

The [Netlib](https://www.netlib.org/lp/data/) mathematical software repository maintains a comprehensive collection of linear programming test problems.

The original readme file for Netlib repository can be found at [readme](https://www.netlib.org/lp/data/readme).

## Overview

This collection contains standard linear programming (LP) test problems that are used to benchmark optimization solvers. The problems are stored in MPS-standard input files.

## Problem Collection

### Summary Statistics

The collection includes 97+ standard problems with the following characteristics:
- **Row counts**: 28 to 16,676
- **Column counts**: 32 to 22,275
- **Nonzero counts**: 88 to 151,120
