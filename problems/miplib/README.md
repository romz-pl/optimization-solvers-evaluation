# MIPLIB â€“ The Mixed Integer Programming Library

[MIPLIB (Mixed Integer Programming Library)](https://miplib2010.zib.de/) is a widely-used benchmark collection in the field of mathematical optimization, specifically for testing and comparing the performance of mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers.

## Purpose and Significance

MIPLIB serves as the standard testbed for evaluating MIP algorithms and solver implementations. Mixed integer programming problems involve optimization where some or all variables must take integer values, which makes them computationally challenging and relevant to many real-world applications.

## History and Evolution

The library was first created in 1992 and has been updated periodically to reflect advances in solver technology and to maintain challenging problem instances:

- **MIPLIB 1.0** (1992): Initial collection
- **MIPLIB 2.0** (1994)
- **MIPLIB 3.0** (1998)
- **MIPLIB 2003**
- **MIPLIB 2010**
- **MIPLIB 2017**: The most recent major version

Each new version typically retains some classic instances while adding new, more challenging problems that reflect the improved capabilities of modern solvers.

## Content

MIPLIB contains problem instances that:
- Come from real industrial and academic applications
- Vary in size and difficulty
- Represent diverse problem structures and characteristics
- Are stored in standard formats (primarily MPS format)

The problems span various application domains including production planning, logistics, telecommunications, scheduling, and circuit design.

## Usage

Researchers and developers use MIPLIB to:
- Benchmark new algorithms and solver improvements
- Compare performance across different solvers
- Conduct reproducible computational experiments
- Identify problem classes where solvers struggle

The library has been instrumental in driving progress in MIP solver technology over the past three decades.
